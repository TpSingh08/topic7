          <p> In the Activity 1 we covered the introdcution to IoT Apps like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> What is an IoT application that is how it exchanges data with other devices over internet and other
              communication networks. </li>
            <li> Main features that are needed in a IoT application.</li>
            <li> Some examples of the IoT apllications like, smart light and security system.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>In Activity 2 we had a basic understanding of a Smart Building</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Meaning of smart in IoT</li>
            <li> Main features that are needed in a Smart building for example measurement sensors.</li>
            <li> Some smart building scenerios like automatic temperature control system and smart emergency and fire
              extinguisher system.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In Activity 3 we did some diging into control interface</p>
          <ul>
            <li> High level features of the control interface like Speed and efficiency was covered.</li>
            <li> Major parts needed for it for example IoT sensors and acutators and graphic user interface.</li>
            <li> Users of the control interface like registered and unregistered.</li>
